Dear Guest,

Thank you for your message.

Please be informed that we use access codes for our reservation.
The access codes are sent on the day of check-in.
To provide you access to the apartment, we must receive a copy of your ID (both sides) or passport.
Could you please send it to customer.service@visionapartments.com?

Best regards,
