Dear Guest,

Thank you for your message.

Please be informed that the access code for your apartment will allow you a contactless check-in at any hour from 3PM.
To provide you access to the apartment, we must receive a copy of your ID (both sides) or passport.
Could you please send it to customer.service@visionapartments.com?

Best regards,
